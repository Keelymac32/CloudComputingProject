# Keelyn's Course Project Kick Start
## Application Nature and Purpose
The nature of this application will be a web-based digital sketchbook that users can create doodles, test out colors schemes or take visual based notes. This application allows for a smoother creative process and grants anyone with access to the internet the ability to design and bring their imagination to the screen. The purpose of the application is  to help students, designers or visual thinkers easily take and create visual notes digitally without knowledge of design software. No longer will users need subscriptions to advanced design softwares or struggle with creating visuals on text based applications like Microsoft Word.
## Estimated modules
Here are the microservices I hope to implement:
Downloading a sketch as JPEG, PNG or PDF
Saving Sketch to Database
Deleting Entire Page
Uploading a specific sketch from database to UI
Undo last mark 
## Estimated languages and frameworks
Langauges: Processing Language and JavaScript
Image Based Database: MongoDB
## General description of the UI with the primary actions
The app will have a simple sketchbook page based UI where lines, shapes and colors can be added. An earser tool will also be available to erase any unwanted marks.There will be several primary action buttons set up on the UI. First being several different options for saving. There will be 3 file formats that the user can save their sketch as being pdf, jpeg and png. The user will also have the option to save their sketch to an image based database. Users will also be able to pull previously saved pages from the databases and continue to update and add to them. There will also be a button to Undo as well as erase everything on the page.
