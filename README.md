# Keelyn's Course Project Kick Start Updated 3/7

## Application Nature and Purpose
The nature of this application will be a web based athletic shoe store. Clients will create an account and have the options to buy athletic sneakers or cleats. There will be two seperate catalogs depending on what the user would like to browse. Users will also be able to star shoes for a later purchase. Once shoes are ordered they will be stored in a "previous orders" section where their status wil be displayed as well as updated once order is complete. The website will also keep track of the previously starred shoes of the user so they can revisit shoes that they had been interested in prior. 

## People Involved
I will be working independently on this project. 

## Estimated modules
Here are the microservices I hope to implement:

Order Placement Service 

Order Status Update Service

Shoe orders will be stored in an Order DB

Star Shoe Service 

Starred shoes will be stored in a Starred Shoe DB 

Purchase Service 

Log-In Service 

New Profile Creation Service

Users profiles will be stored in a Users DB

Sneaker Catalog service 

Sneakers can be stored in sneaker DB

Cleats Catalog 

Cleats will be stored in shoe DB

## Statement of the estimated languages and frameworks

*Not fully complete still working through what languages would be best *

Javascript and NodeJs - Front End Components
GoLang - for user profiles
Python - for ordering and payment
MongoDB - for databases

## General description of the UI with the primary actions
The app will have a simple log in page where the user can either log in or set up an account. Once logged in the user will be able to toggle between a cleat catalog and sneaker catalog. Users will have the option to click and buy the shoe or star the shoe by selecting a star icon in the corner of the displayed shoe. Once clicked, purchasing info will be displayed. The user will just have to put in their information and click confirm. There will be two tabs in the upper part of the UI that are "orders" and "stars" these will hold previous/current orders and their completition status as well as the previously starred shoes.
